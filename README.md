# skill-matrix

Skill Matrix project based on Hasura &amp; ForrestJS

# How to Run the Project

> The following commands have been tested on Mac and Linux.

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:forrestjs/skill-matrix.git && cd skill-matrix
```

Use the Make interface:

```bash
make start
```

Or run it via Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up hasura-cli
```

ðŸ‘‰ Else you can enjoy a **cloud-based automated Workspace** and run it on GitPod.io:

# Services

This project rotates around Postgres and [Hasura Engine][hasura].

Hasura provides a CRUD interface towards Postgres (and other dbms) but lacks the ability to perform business logic.

Although a lot of business logic can be carried out on the DB by running _Server Side SQL functions_, you may also need to run stuff in languages such as NodeJS or Java.

ðŸ‘‰ The classic Backend App ðŸ‘ˆ

In this project, I have created 3 NodeJS services that extends Hasura's capabilities using the 3 possible methods:

- [Hasura Event Triggers](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/event-triggers/index/)
- [Hasura Actions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/actions/index/)
- [Remote Schemas](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index/)

## Hasura Events

It's a NodeJS service based on [ForrestJS][forrestjs] and [Fastify][fastify] that offers _REST APIs_ for the implementation of [Hasura Event Triggers](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/event-triggers/index/).

Please extend this App with all the Event Triggers that you may need to fulfill your **after-write business logic**.

## Hasura Actions

It's a NodeJS service based on [ForrestJS][forrestjs] and [Fastify][fastify] that offers _REST APIs_ for the implementation of [Hasura Actions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/actions/index/).

Please extend this App with all the Actions that you may need to implement custom business logic that should be proxied through Hasura's API.

---

## GraphQL API

It's a NodeJS service based on [ForrestJS][forrestjs] and [Apollo Server][apollo-server] that offers a custom _GraphQL API_. Hasura uses this API via [Remote Schemas](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index/).

Please extend this App if you want to play with a fully custom GraphQL Server. But honestly, I believe that Actions are a better implementation of the same goal.

# JWT Tokens

In this project we use the [Hasura JWT Authentication](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authentication/jwt/) method and we implement 3 roles:

- backend
- backoffice
- form

## Backend

This JWT is provided to the Backend Services and allows them to query Hasura on behalf of any user.

ðŸ”¥ A token like this is quite powerful and dangerous, the Backend Service should generate short-living tokens and rotate them as much as possibile in order to maximize security.

```json
{
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["backend"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "backend"
  }
}
```

---

## Backoffice

This JWT is used as login to the Backoffice App and make super-user changes to the system.

The variable `x-hasura-admin-id` should be used for logging any backoffice activity by any authenticated administrator.

ðŸ”¥ A token like this is quite powerful and dangerous, any Backoffice sessions should be short-lived (5 minutes?) and traced to an Admin itentity.

ðŸ‘‰ Also, Backoffice Apps should be restricted to explicit Actions or Remote Schemas where custom business logic is being used to make sure adequate application logging is performed.

```json
{
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["backoffice"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "backoffice",
    "x-hasura-admin-id": "xxx"
  }
}
```

---

## FormApp

This JWT is released to a specific user in association with the invite to fill a specific form.

This is the most specific of the JWT we are going to use in this app, and it should provide a very targeted write-only access to the database.

ðŸ‘‰ The Authentication Authority that releases this token should take care of syncronizing the token's `nbf` and `exp` to the Form's `open_since` and `open_until` timestamps.

```json
{
  "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": {
    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["form"],
    "x-hasura-default-role": "form",
    "x-hasura-user-id": "xxx",
    "x-hasura-form-id": "xxx"
  }
}
```
